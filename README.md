# Modeling Collective Behavior in Ants

This project aims to model the collective behavior observed in ant colonies. By simulating the interactions and decision-making processes of individual ants, we can gain insights into how they collectively achieve complex tasks such as foraging, nest building, and defense.

## Introduction

Ants are known for their remarkable ability to work together as a cohesive unit, exhibiting emergent behavior that allows them to solve complex problems. This project explores the underlying mechanisms behind this collective behavior and aims to create a simulation that accurately represents the dynamics of an ant colony.

## Installation

To run this simulation, you will need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your machine. Additionally, you will need to install the following dependencies:

```
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install seaborn
pip install mesa
```

## Usage

To start the simulation, simply run the `main.py` script:

```
python main.py
```

The simulation will generate visualizations of the ants' behavior and provide insights into their collective decision-making processes.
